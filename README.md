# ![Sitecore logo in red background](https://github.com/Sitecore/developer-portal/raw/main/apps/devportal/public/favicon-32x32.png) Sitecore Accelerate Reference Architecture

Welcome to the Sitecore Accelerate Reference Architecture repository. 

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository aims to demonstrate how to implement Sitecore's headless products based on the [Sitecore Accelerate recipes](https://developers.sitecore.com/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud). It provides a reference architecture that developers can follow to efficiently build headless Sitecore solutions while adhering to best practices and industry standards.

## Getting Started

Each reference architecture in this repo will have its own readme.md and getting started guide. Please locate the reference architecture you want to look at from the folders listed:

-  XM Cloud
  -  Multisite using the JSS Multisite Add-on
  -  Multisite using a single application per site
